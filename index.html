        <h2>Home Brewing</h2>
        <p>
          Homebrewing is the brewing of beer on a small scale for personal, non-commercial purposes. Beer has been brewed on the domestic level since its advent, thousands of years prior to its commercial production. Through the years its legality has varied according to local regulation.

          Beer has been brewed domestically throughout its 7,000-year history, beginning in the Neolithic period in Mesopotamia (modern Iraq), Egypt and China. It seems to have first developed as thick beers; during this time meads, fruit wines and rice wines were also developed.</p>

        <h2>Drink Responsibly</h2>
        <p>
          Drinking enjoyably, sociably and pacing yourself.
          Not drinking at all in situations when the effects of alcohol will put someone's safety or health at risk â€“ such as when driving, when pregnant or in certain work situations. As a parent it means being aware of the risks associated with underage drinking and setting an example of moderation. It also means that as a parent you should take an active role in setting limits for your children not to drink.

        <h2>Be Patient</h2>
        <p>
          Like most things good, they come to those who wait. Beer meets this paradigm with a brief, but necessary period to develop taste, carbonation and the all important alcohol content. The period varies from weeks to months, but well worthwhile the wait.
